    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>
      Hi there! I'm Patrick, and I'm a computer science Masters student at
      Virginia Tech studying artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data
      analytics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love learning and experimenting with new technologies, and I am
      constantly working on cool new <a href="{base}/projects">projects</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most recent project I've been working on an note taking application
      with automatic note linking capabilities using a custom keyword extraction
      system (<a href="https://github.com/oolong-sh/oolongd">link</a>).
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm somewhat obsessed with optimizing every part of my developer workflow,
      and I've written vim plugins and cli/tui applications to try and be
      blazingly fast in everything I do.
    </p>
    <p>
      I also have a <a href="{base}/blog">blog</a> where I <em>occasionally</em>
      write articles.

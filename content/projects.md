## [FRC Scouting Database V2](https://github.com/ptdewey/frc-scouting-database-v2)
* Improved event statistics and match predictions database for FIRST Robotics Competition events that is easily deployable to the cloud using Docker, and achieves upwards of 80% match prediction accuracy.
* Includes Docker image specifications for quick deployment, and tests to ensure everything is working as intended.
* Written in Go.

## [CUDA Neural Network](https://github.com/ptdewey/cuda-nn)
* A modular feed-forward neural network implementation written in CUDA C++ without any libraries.
* Includes various activation functions (ReLU, Tanh, Sigmoid, Softmax), and a few cost functions (Mean Square Error, Categorical Cross Entropy, Binary Cross Entropy).
* Capable of both binary and multi-class classification problems, as well as regression tasks.

## [Visualizing *What* Neural Networks Learn](https://pdewey.com/neural-net-viz)
* A website showcasing animated visualizations of the neural network learning process

## Riverine Flood Prediction
* Built a data processing system for cleaning and merging geographical and time series weather data.
* Developed a flood prediction model for the Roanoke River watershed that achieves 95+% accuracy.
* Written in Python with Numpy, Pandas, GeoPandas, Rasterio, and PyTorch

## [YankBank-nvim](https://github.com/ptdewey/yankbank-nvim)
* Versatile Neovim plugin that offers an enhanced clipboard history interface with a quick-access menu, featuring session persistence through SQLite3 or JSON file storage, widely adopted for its configurability
* Written in Lua

## [Pendulum-nvim](https://github.com/ptdewey/pendulum-nvim)
* Neovim plugin that monitors coding duration and compiles metrics such as git project name, file type, and additional parameters, providing insightful data for productivity analysis.
* Written in Lua

## [FRC Scouting Database](https://github.com/ptdewey/frc-scouting-database)
* A scouting and event predictions database for FIRST Robotics Competition events, using The Blue Alliance API.
* Uses statistical modeling methods to estimate team contributions during matches in order to quantitatively rank teams and make predictions.
* Written in R, using Tidyverse, dplyr, and ggplot.

## [Linux Dotfiles](https://github.com/ptdewey/dotfiles)
* A collection of configuration files and scripts I use every day on my Linux desktop.
* Contains my Neovim configuration along featuring custom Lua functions I wrote that allow for faster directory traversal and quicker fuzzy finding.
* Includes a quick setup script that allows me to get working on any system in minutes.
* Also includes nix configuration files to allow for better reproducibility across any type of unix system.

## [SpotiPy Wrapped](https://github.com/ptdewey/SpotiPy-Wrapped)
* Statistical analysis and visualization of Spotify personal data obtained via request and from the API
* Comes with Jupyter Notebook for quick and easy visualizations
* Includes live playback logging scripts to improve insights
* Written in Python and R
* Utilizes the Spotify API, ggplot, dplyr, Tidyverse, Matplotlib, Pandas, and Jupyter

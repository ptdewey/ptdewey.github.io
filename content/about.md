My name is Patrick Dewey, and I am graduate student at Virginia Tech.
I am currently in the computer science Masters of Engineering program, with focus areas in machine learning and high performance computing.

I am a software developer and data scientist, and I am an avid Neovim user (I've written 3 plugins and contributed to a few others).
